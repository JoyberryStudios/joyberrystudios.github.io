Spring is officially here and with that comes more time outside on our patio enjoying the warmer weather and sunshine. There is something about being outside that makes me want to take things a bit slower. I love to sit with my feet up and a fun drink in my hand while I watch my little one play in her water table.

This summer we are getting a nice pizza oven for outside and I’m dreaming of all of the meals I want to share with others on our patio.

The energy of our patio space is much different than inside. My decorating style for the inside of my house is calm, light, and cozy. I want my patio space to be a bit more fun and full of energy. Painting a set of glasses to use outside was an easy way to bring more joy and life into the space. 

There are so many different ways that you can paint these glasses. You can add a simple band of color at the bottom for a more subtle look. Or you can use bright colors and paint all over for a more bold look. The options are endless!

The best part about these glasses is that they are dishwasher safe and hold the paint incredibly well. I’ve had glasses painted with this technique from college (almost ten years old) and they still look great!

## Supplies

![supplies](/assets/images/blogs/April2021/paintedGlasses/supplies.jpg)

* Acrylic Paint (can be found at any craft store)

* Paint Brushes

* Clean Glasses (glass or ceramic, not plastic)

## Prep

![clean](/assets/images/blogs/April2021/paintedGlasses/clean.jpg)

Make sure that your glasses are CLEAN. If there are any oils or residue on them the paint won’t stick as well. 

Before you paint make sure you clean them well with soap and dry them with a clean towel or you can wipe them down with alcohol. When you look at the glasses, they should be sparkling clean!

## Painting

When painting these glasses I suggest that you don’t paint the top inch or so of the glass. The paint can add a bit of texture to the glass and it might feel strange to have your lips/mouth touch the painted glass.

There are so many different designs you can do! Feel free to create your own, but If you would like a few suggestions or inspiration you can start here!

(I also apologize in advance. Taking photos of clear glasses is much harder than I anticipated!)

![dots](/assets/images/blogs/April2021/paintedGlasses/dots.jpg)

You can use the opposite end of your paint brush to make little dots all over your glass. This is a simple and fun way to add a pop of color. To make larger dots you just simply need more paint on the end of your paint brush.

![confetti](/assets/images/blogs/April2021/paintedGlasses/confetti.jpg)

You can free hand paint some pieces of confetti all over your glass. I liked adding different shapes and sizes of confetti here. To do this you can use just different size brushes. I also like that you can see a bit of the brush strokes in the glass. If you want a more opaque look, add a few coats!

![taped](/assets/images/blogs/April2021/paintedGlasses/taped.jpg)

You can also use painters tape, washi tape, or electrical tape to block off part of the bottom of your glass to paint larger sections with a clean edge. 

Be aware that it is really hard to tape a perfectly level section on a curved glass. Just play around with the tape and make sure it has a nice seal before you start painting. After the paint sets, take off the paint and you can use a fingernail to push any bleeds back into the painted section.

## Curing

![oven](/assets/images/blogs/April2021/paintedGlasses/oven.jpg)

Place your glasses into your cold oven. Make sure that none of the paint is touching the oven. You can place it directly onto the rack or on a baking sheet.

Preheat your oven to 350F. Once it is up to temp, keep it on for another 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, turn off your oven. Keep the door closed and let your glasses cool in the oven. I usually check on them after a few hours.

Alternatively, you can let your glasses air dry for 21 days. 

## Care

Once cured, your painted dishes can withstand a lot! I did this technique years ago and the glasses have been in the dishwasher dozens of times and they still look great!

If you’re nervous, hand washing is always a safe route!

## Bonus Mocktail Recipe

![cocktail](/assets/images/blogs/April2021/paintedGlasses/cocktail.jpg)

I’m a big fan of mocktails. I do drink alcohol occasionally, but mocktails can be just as delicious without any impending headaches.

*Ingredients*

* 2 Tablespoons - Mango Puree (throw some mangos in a blender)

* 2 Tablespoons - Ginger Syrup (1C sugar, 1C water, 3” of ginger peeled and thinly sliced simmered for 10 min)

* Limes

* ½ C - Seltzer

Mix the mango puree, ginger syrup, and a few drops of lime together. Pour in seltzer and mix. Add Ice. Enjoy!
