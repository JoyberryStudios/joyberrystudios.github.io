I loved dyeing Easter eggs as a kid. We always used hard boiled eggs and the vinegar kits from the grocery store. I remember being so upset we had to keep our eggs in the fridge and absolutely disgusted when my mom suggested I eat one.

As an adult I still love doing these nostalgic activities. With age comes wisdom and I now know I don’t need the grocery store kit to make them and that I can make a delicious quiche with the eggs and have them out on display all season. 

## Preparing the Eggs

You may think that blowing out eggs is messy, and takes a lot of time and effort. This can all absolutely be true, but with some tips and tricks I have hopefully you can blow out a dozen eggs in 15 minutes or less without feeling like you’re going to faint. 

![tape](/assets/images/blogs/March2021/dyingEggs/tape.jpg)

First you need a bowl to blow your eggs into, some tape, and a safety pin or needle. Tape the top and bottoms of the eggs and use the safety pin to pierce a hole in the top and bottoms on the egg.

You want this hole to be a few millimeters in size. The bigger it is the easier it will be to blow out your eggs. When you’re in there, move the safety pin in and out of the egg, piercing the yolk. 

Close up the holes with your fingers and give it a good hard shake. This is to mix up the white and the yolk.

Bring it to the sink and use a bit of soap to clean off the top of the egg. You want to make sure you’re not ingesting raw egg. 

Over a bowl, place your mouth on the smaller of the two holes and blow. You want to make sure you have a good seal against the egg. 

Continue to blow out all of the egg and then rinse them with water

If you’re struggling to blow out the egg. Try making the holes a little larger, especially the hole you’re trying to blow the egg out of.

Please do not overexert yourself. If you feel like you are getting lightheaded, absolutely stop and make the hole bigger. Absolutely do not faint while making Easter eggs, it is not worth it!

Towel them off and let them dry!

## Marble Dying The Eggs

Put some shaving cream or whipped cream into a muffin tin. You can get multiple dyes out of each muffin hole. 

If you use the water based normal food coloring your eggs will turn out really light. It was frustrating for me to figure out why my eggs didn’t look like everyone else’s on the internet.  Turns out it is best to use the gel based food dye or the neon food dye. 

![swirl](/assets/images/blogs/March2021/dyingEggs/swirl.jpg)

Drop some food coloring onto the cream and swirl it with a toothpick. Be sure to swirl the food coloring into the shaving cream. It shouldn’t just be on the surface. The more food coloring you use the better your eggs will turn out. (I added more after this photo.)

![dip](/assets/images/blogs/March2021/dyingEggs/dip.jpg)

Place an egg on top of the swirled food coloring and gently spin it so It picks up food coloring. Make sure the entire egg is covered. You can place it in an empty muffin tin while it rests

![rest](/assets/images/blogs/March2021/dyingEggs/rest.jpg)

Let the eggs sit for 15 minutes and then you can either rinse them off with COLD water or wipe off the extra with a paper towel. 

If you find your eggs are not colored enough you can try a few things:
* using a stronger food coloring (gel or neon)
* Using more food coloring
* Let them sit for longer
* Try wiping them instead of rinsing them
