I love my [garden](https://joyberrystudios.com/2021/05/10/buildGarden.html). I tend to it nearly every day and it is plentiful. My house plants on the other hand? So far 3 out of 5 of them have died within the few short months I’ve had them. Yikes!

I love the idea of having plants in my home. At this moment in my life, indoor plants are just not working for me. So I have turned to the best alternative *DRIED PLANTS!*

## Perks of Displaying Dried Plants

Dried plants are trending right now. Dried grasses (lookin’ at you pampas grass) are all over social media. They are gorgeous and EASY. What is not to love?

If you think about the negatives for houseplants or bouquets of flowers, they are almost all non-issues for dried plants:

* no watering 
* no surprise fungus
* no moldy leaves
* lasts longer than two weeks

## Pick Your Flowers

My neighbors grew the most impressive lavender earlier this summer. It cascaded down over their entire front walk and it was filled with bees. They said they couldn’t bring themselves to trim it back because of how much the bees loved it. It was absolutely worth walking on their grass instead of their sidewalk to have.

My mom braved the bees while I stood a house away and she picked several stems for me. (I told her I didn’t want to risk my little toddler getting stung. I may also have some bee anxiety after a wasp flew up my shorts when I was riding my bike two summers ago.)

If you don’t have any fresh lavender to pick, that's okay! I’ve done this technique before with some *grasses* I found outside and *eucalyptus* leaves from a flower bouquet someone gifted me.

Some other great flowers to dry are:

* Baby’s Breath
* Coneflower
* Hydrangea
* Pansies
* Roses
* Big Blue Sea Holly
* Dragon’s Breath
* Strawflowers

## Avoid Leafy Foliage

Thick leaves like eucalyptus and grasses are okay to dry, but you don’t want to dry the leaves on the stems of most flowers. If the leaves get brown and droopy when they naturally die, they are not going to look good in your dried bouquet.

Pick off those leaves before moving onto the next step!

## Hanging Your Flowers to Dry

![materials to dry flowers](/assets/images/blogs/August2021/driedLavender/materials.jpg)

You don’t need anything super fancy when you dry your flowers. Just some twine, string, or rubber bands. 

Gather your flowers or grasses into a bundle. Dried flowers can become delicate once they are dried, so arrange your flowers how you would like them to look when they are displayed dried.

![tied Lavender](/assets/images/blogs/August2021/driedLavender/tiedLavender.jpg)

Tie your bouquet at least twice down the stems. You really want to make sure the flowers are tight and don’t fall out since you will be hanging this upside down. Take another piece of string and make a loop to hang the bouquet from.

## Drying Your Flowers

You want to hang your flowers so they are upside down. This will help the stems dry so they stand upright, instead of drooping down. 

Hang them in a cool dry place. (Basements are great! Steamy shower filled bathrooms are not so great…)

After about two weeks, check on your flowers. If they seem a little crisp, feel free to stick them in a vase and enjoy them!

## More Dried Flowers Please!

Next year when we plant flowers for landscaping, I plan on only planting flowers that I can dry and enjoy year round. They will serve two purposes!

I’ve also had it on my bucket list to visit a flower truck or bar. There is a flower truck in Columbus, called [Rosie the Flower Truck](https://www.instagram.com/rosie.theflowertruck/) where you can build your own bouquet. HOW FUN!
