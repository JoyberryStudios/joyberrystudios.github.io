After I made a [Scout Tee](https://joyberrystudios.com/2021/05/10/scoutTee.html) for my mom I knew I wanted to make more. [The Scout Tee Pattern from Grainline Studio](https://grainlinestudio.com/collections/summer-patterns/products/scout-tee?variant=22533587533906) is one of my favorites.

When I first started sewing I never thought I would purchase such a simple pattern. I found that it is such a well drafted pattern that fits wonderfully. I also love the flexibility that such a simple pattern has! I find that I can be more creative with my sewing practice and use this as a jumping off point for future projects!.

## Inspiration

I love wearing dresses in the summer. They are effortless and put together all at the same time. I love dresses that are flowy and still allow me to be on the move and comfortable. I don’t want to worry about sliding straps, weird sunburn lines, it being uncomfortably tight. I just want to feel comfortable and confident.

The scout tee has a great fit. I love how the neckline lays and the sleeves are the perfect size for some shoulder coverage. I don’t have a particularly curvy body, so I thought I could just lengthen the bodice and add a waist tie and it would be perfect! 

## Fabric

If you make the Scout Tee you definitely want something drapey. I’ve used [Robert Kaufman’s Brussels Washer](https://sewtospeakshoppe.com/search?type=product&options%5Bprefix%5D=last&q=washer) before, but for the ultimate and comfortable summer dress I wanted to try using [double gauze](https://sewtospeakshoppe.com/search?type=product&options%5Bprefix%5D=last&options%5Bunavailable_products%5D=last&q=gauze).

Baby blankets, swaddles, and rompers are usually made out of double gauze because it is seriously SO SOFT. It is buttery and breathable all at the same time. It does have a bit of a wrinkled and bubbly look to it, but I think it gives it some character. It makes a gorgeous loungey dress. I would not make a formal dress out of it.

## Pattern Hack

My hack for this dress was super simple. I made sure I was making a size that would accommodate my hips and I just simply added 15 inches to the bottom. I followed the same curve as the top downward, but I didn’t make any extra adjustments to make more room for my hips. With my body shape I knew I didn’t need to.

I cut out a size 12 and I was able to fold my 52 inch fabric so I could cut both main pieces out of one big piece of fabric, instead of having to lay my pieces end to end. This really helps cut down on the length of fabric that I needed to purchase. I still have to cut out the sleeves and the tie, but I could have made this dress with only 1.5 yards!

![waist tie closeup](/assets/images/blogs/May2021/scoutTeeDress/waistTie.jpg)

To cut out the waist tie I simply just cut two 4 inch wide strips of fabric in the area where I found the most remaining fabric. I sewed the two long rectangles together and then folded over sewed a long tube. Turned the tube rightside out, ironed flat, and added stitching along each side. My tie ended up being around 1.5 yards in length.

## Final Thoughts

I just want to live in this dress. It has perfect coverage and I love the length. I feel like I can move around in it. I’m never worried that my dress has come up in the back or that the front of my shirt is gaping when I bend over. I took photos with my sister in 85 degree weather and I never felt uncomfortable.

My daughter asks to go outside to play as soon as she wakes up. I need clothes that I can still live my life in. I need to be able to run down the sidewalk, sit on the patio, water the garden, and weed the flower beds. Not a lot of dresses check all the boxes, but this dress does!
