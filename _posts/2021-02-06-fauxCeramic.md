When we moved into our new home we suddenly had a lot of open shelves to display all of our beautiful things. The only issue was that we didn’t have a whole lot of beautiful things. I am a pretty practical person, especially when it comes to spending money on things. I’m not going to spend $30 on a vase just because it looks pretty on our shelf. I received a lot of hand me downs from older family members and we are in the process of DIYing our way to Instagram worthy shelves.

This is a tea set that we’ve had on our shelves for about a year. We will never use it, but I liked the shape of the teapot and the matching little pots. I also know that things look best in threes, so I kept them all. 

I saw [XO MaCenna] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7JgWtepghI&t=743s “MaCenna”) paint ceramic and glass vases so they had a faux ceramic look. I loved them! And they seemed so simple! So I am following a similar technique. If you want to learn more, definitely check out her video!

## Supplies
*a paint sample from a hardware store
*baking soda
*paint brush
*glass or ceramic pieces of paint

Getting paint from a hardware store may seem a little daunting. But you can get 1 Cup of paint in literally any color that you can dream of for $3. (Note though, you can’t simply throw out old latex paint you don’t want. You have to let it dry or you can buy a hardener for it.)

## Step One - Mixing Paint

I did all of my mixing on a paper plate. You could also use an old yogurt container with a lid if you wanted ample drying time between your coats. 

To mix I added around ¼ cup of paint with 1-2 tablespoons of baking soda. The more baking soda you add the more chalky and textured the finish will be. Start by adding a little, and continue to add more if you want. You can also do a first coat and adjust the paint mixture for a second coat. 

## Step Two - Painting

Soak your brush full of paint and do a nice smooth brush stroke across your piece. To make the most uniform finish, work quickly, make sure your brush is always full of paint, and do full brush strokes from the top to the bottom of the piece.

If you find your paint is getting tacky and gummy. Stop painting. Let that coat dry and reassess once it is dry. If there are big chunks, you can try to sand off some of the paint, be sure to work outside and with a mask on. You don’t want latex paint in your lungs! If it’s just a bit of a funky texture, try blending it with a second coat of paint.

The temperature and humidity will dictate how long it takes each coat to dry. It is the middle of winter here, so my house is at 72 with a skin cracking 22% humidity. Within ten minutes my pieces were dry to the touch and I was able to apply a second coat. 

## Step Three - Admire

Take a step back, pat yourself on the back, and admire your work! Hopefully much better than before! This is such a fun and quick way to add a splash of color and texture to your home.
