I am so fortunate that my parents invested in some higher quality wooden toys that my minimalist mother just happened to save. Now that I have a family of my own, my mom is passing down some of those toys to us. I am so thankful!

There used to be a 1990’s version of a Makerspace, where as my mom describes it, a bunch of older men would get together and do wood working together and sell what they made in a little store front. She bought a set of children’s table and chairs, a doll high chair and bassinet, and a dollhouse from them. My mom saved all of them and now my daughter gets to enjoy them as well!

## Original Dollhouse

![originalExteriorDollHouse](/assets/images/blogs/January2022/dollHouseMakeover/originalExterior.jpg)

This was the dollhouse that I had growing up. I spent hours playing with this dollhouse. I think the wooden hearts on the top are quintessential 90’s and I love the color palette that my mom chose. It even still had a few fake plants on the window sills and the top two windows are broken and held in place with packaging tape.

My mom also painted the inside rooms. I love that she added texture with the blue paint!

I knew that I wanted to give the dollhouse a facelift and make it a little more gender neutral. I knew I could fix the broken windows, replace the sparse flower beds, and make it look a bit more polished.

## Exterior Renovations

![finalExterior](/assets/images/blogs/January2022/dollHouseMakeover/exterior.jpg)

First, I removed the wooden hearts at the top of the dollhouse and did an overall wood fill and sand to the entire piece. I gave it a fresh coat of paint: [Silverado Sage by Magnolia Paint](https://magnolia.com/shop/product/4767569540/silverado-sage/) is the green color, [No Limits by Sherwin Williams HGSW 1461](https://www.lowes.com/pd/HGTV-HOME-by-Sherwin-Williams-Limits-Interior-Eggshell-Paint-Sample-Actual-Net-Contents-29-fl-oz/50389984) is the deep navy color, and [Pediment by Sherwin Williams](https://www.sherwin-williams.com/homeowners/color/find-and-explore-colors/paint-colors-by-family/SW7634-pediment) is the off white color.

I’m still not super happy with the front door “windows”, I may come in and fill them in later. I may also add more greenery or small little pots to the front steps. 

![windowCloseUp](/assets/images/blogs/January2022/dollHouseMakeover/window.jpg)

I used a spackling knife to remove the trim around the top two windows and I replaced the window pane with a similar plastic that I found on a cheap picture frame. You can’t really cut this kind of thin plastic. (You score it with a blade and then break it!)

![fauxFlorals](/assets/images/blogs/January2022/dollHouseMakeover/fauxFlorals.jpg)

I really struggled to find small florals that I could put in the window boxes. It seemed like dollhouse flowers were going to be really expensive. Instead I bought this faux foliage from JoAnns and glued on the leaves to the flower boxes. I think I like the overall more neutral look.

## Interior Renovations

![finalDollHouseOpen](/assets/images/blogs/January2022/dollHouseMakeover/finalOpen.jpg)

For the interior I thought it would be fun to do something a bit different than just paint. I loved the thought of “wallpaper” and incorporating some fun patterns into the house. 

![ParkLaneSonoma](/assets/images/blogs/January2022/dollHouseMakeover/ParkLaneSonoma.jpg)

I found this collection of scrapbooking papers at my local JoAnns. It is [Park Lane - Sonoma](https://www.joann.com/park-lane-sonoma-12x12-big-deal-stack/18271411.html). I fell in love with the geometric and floral patterns. I also love that it had some “wood” paper, which is perfect for floors!

(Whenever shopping at JoAnns be sure to use coupons! I got this stack of paper for $3 on a super sale.)

To size the scrap booking paper to the walls and floors I placed a corner of the paper into the upper corner of a wall and simply gave the paper a crease at the floor and exterior of the wall. I then used my paper cutter to give it a clean straight cut.

To adhere the paper to the walls/floors I used double sided tape. I knew this may not be the best long term solution, but I didn’t want to use a strong adhesive that would ruin the walls. I can always replace the paper or decide to paint the walls if this doesn’t work out long term.

The following are close ups of every room. I discuss the furniture in the following section.

![doubleBedroom](/assets/images/blogs/January2022/dollHouseMakeover/doubleBedroom.jpg)

I love how the paper wood flooring turned out!

![singleBedroom](/assets/images/blogs/January2022/dollHouseMakeover/singleBedroom.jpg)

This scrapbooking paper was my favorite! I also felt like the original floors in here were good enough to keep exposed. 

![livingRoom](/assets/images/blogs/January2022/dollHouseMakeover/livingRoom.jpg)

Another room with the paper wood floors and fun floral wallpaper.

![bathroom](/assets/images/blogs/January2022/dollHouseMakeover/bathroom.jpg)

This tile floor is actually the tile floor my mom made with a ruler and pen for when I was little. It was still in pretty good shape and I love it, so I incorporating it into the renovation.

![kitchen](/assets/images/blogs/January2022/dollHouseMakeover/kitchen.jpg)

I thought the paper I used in this room looked a bit like tile. If I used a patterned floor I tried to use a more subtle wallpaper, so the little room didn’t feel overwhelming.

![diningRoom](/assets/images/blogs/January2022/dollHouseMakeover/diningRoom.jpg)

Another favorite paper. I love the dark green florals with gold accents!

## Dollhouse Furniture

I am so happy that my mom also saved all of my dollhouse furniture from my childhood. It is high quality wooden furniture from [Plan Toys](https://usa.plantoys.com), which you can purchase in the US through [Bella Luna Toys](https://www.bellalunatoys.com/search?q=wooden%20dollhouse%20furniture&_=pf&pf_t_category=Dollhouse%20Furniture).

To my surprise, the Plan Toys dollhouse furniture has not changed in 25 years, so you can purchase this exact same furniture!

We also have a lot of additional pieces like play kitchen food, lamps, books, and other small knick knacks. My daughter is still little and we have a baby on the way, so I decided to keep the decor simple, at least for another few years!

## Sustainability

I love giving my childhood toys or toys that I find second hand ([like our play kitchen](https://joyberrystudios.com/2022/01/01/playKitchenMakeover.html)) a makeover so they can serve our family for years to come. Reusing toys through different childhoods keeps those toys out of landfills.

![PlanToysVictorianDollHouse](/assets/images/blogs/January2022/dollHouseMakeover/PlanToysVictorianDollHouse.jpg)

Higher quality toys that can last a generation or through multiple children typically cost more than their cheaper plastic alternatives. This gorgeous [dollhouse from Plan Toys](https://www.crateandbarrel.com/plan-toys-victorian-dollhouse/s658132) is everything I would love in a dollhouse, but we cannot afford the $380 price tag. Buying second hand is a great alternative!

You can also look for brands that are focused on sustainability. [Plan Toys](https://usa.plantoys.com) use water-based colors, glue that doesn’t contain formaldehyde, and uses leftover sawdust to create their “PlanWood”(™), which they make their toys out of. 

![PlanToysSustainableDollHouse](/assets/images/blogs/January2022/dollHouseMakeover/PlanToysSustainableDollHouse.jpg)

Plan Toys even makes this [Green dollhouse](https://plantoys.com/product/green-dollhouse-with-furniture) complete with solar panels, wind turbine, recycling bins, rain barrel, and more.
