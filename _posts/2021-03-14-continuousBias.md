Bias tape can be used in more things than just quilt binding. I’ve used it on straps for masks, necklines, and bags. I just needed to make some for the finishing the edges of my next sewing project, a Tamarack Jacket by Grainline Studios.

In the past, whenever I’ve made bias tape I always cut into the middle of a piece of fabric or cut a bunch of small pieces that I took one by one to my sewing machine. No matter how much I checked, I always sewed a piece to the wrong side. 

Turns out there is a much easier way to make bias tape. Learning how to make this continuous bias tape is a game changer for sure. It goes so much faster and looks better. 


## Materials

![materials](/assets/images/blogs/March2021/continuousBias/materialsBias.jpg)

* fat quarter of fabric

* ruler

* scissors

* marker

* optional: cutting mat

* optional: rotary cutter 

## Instructions:

![triangles](/assets/images/blogs/March2021/continuousBias/cutSquare.jpg)

1. Cut your fat quarter so it is a square. Then cut the square on the diagonal (45 degree angle). You will be left with two identical triangles of fabric.

 2. Rotate the top triangle 90 degrees and align the left edges of each triangle together. (It should look like the above photo.) Sew this left seam together with a ¼ inch seam allowance.

3. Open the seam and press.

4. Starting at the bottom, mark the width of your bias strip. I wanted ½ inch double folded bias tape, so I marked 2 inch increments on my fabric. (You can use a permanent marker here or pen since it will be within the folds of the bias tape. Just be sure it doesn’t bleed through to the surface below)

5. Trim off any extra fabric at the top.

6. Flip your fabric over, so that your markings are face down on the table. Turn over the edges of the fabric and align the first row of markings to the second row of markings. You will want these two lines to cross ¼ inch in from the edge of the fabric. In a few steps you will sew this seam with a ¼ inch seam allowance, you want these two lines to cross right where you stitch. Pin this intersection.

7. Continue to align and pin the next intersecting lines. Add pins at the top and bottom of the seams to make sure the fabric is secure the entire length of the seam. Sew this seam with a ¼ inch seam allowance.

8. Press the seam open.

9. Starting at the top, cut along your marked lines. As you begin to cut the tube, you will see that it spirals and you can continue cutting along this line until the entire tube is cut into bias tape.

10. Once you are done cutting, iron your bias tape into either single or double fold bias tape. 



Isn’t that so much easier than cutting strips, trying to align them all, and sewing a bunch of separate seams? After learning this technique, I don’t think I’ll ever go back!
