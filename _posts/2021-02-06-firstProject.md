When I first started sewing, the thought of sewing garments was absolutely daunting. I was just going to stick to bibs and burp cloths. Maybe a simple blanket. People who sewed clothes were someone who I obviously was not.

Turns out you can sew too many burp cloths and bibs before you want to move onto something new. I started going down rabbit holes on Instagram of other creatives who sewed their own clothes and I loved the idea of making my little one clothes out of the fabric I fell in love with at my local fabric store. I was ready to try to sew clothes!



Even if you don’t have a little one, I think making a dress for a little one is a really great first garment. You can learn so much about garment construction, they typically are a quick sew, and dresses for kids under a year typically only take one yard of fabric! Cheap and quick? Sign me up!

My first dress took me about a week of sewing at night. (Don’t let that scare you! I spent 90% of that time just thinking and researching.) I scoured over the pattern instructions before sewing and I watched several videos just to understand the construction more. I wish I had just used some scrap fabric and went full steam ahead. I absolutely learned the most by doing, not by watching or reading!

Depending on the dress pattern you sew, you can learn so many different techniques: cutting fabric with the grainline, sewing curved seams, gathering, finishing seams, connecting sleeves, zippers or buttons, pockets, adding a lining, different collars. The options are endless and you can easily add on and modify the pattern if you want!

The Geranium Dress by Made-By-Rae is my go to dress pattern. I also love their expansion pack! If you don’t want to purchase a pattern, there are several dress patterns for free online, or you can see if your library offers free classes on Creativebug, an online creative skills resource.

I recently surprised myself by sewing my daughter an entire dress in just one evening and I went from sewing girls dresses to sewing myself my own garments. Now I keep a little spot in her closet to showcase all of the dresses I made her. They bring me so much joy!
