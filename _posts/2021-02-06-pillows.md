After having a child and COVID hitting a few months after, I’ve never spent this much time at home. I am so thankful for this house and all that it has to offer our family. I try my best to keep it tidy and respect everything that we own. I am a bit of a frugal minimalist, so when it comes to decorating I try to focus on things that won’t take up a lot of space or break the bank. I also like to decorate with the changing seasons and occasional holiday. Sewing my own pillow covers gives me the flexibility to make those small but impactful changes to the overall mood of a room.

Making a zippered pillow cover may seem a little daunting at first, but I can walk you through the details! First you need to measure your pillow from corner to corner. I find it’s easiest to use a piece of string and measure the length of string with a ruler. My pillows were 22 inches wide.

<h2> Let’s gather some materials! </h2>

1. Fabric (amount listed in first step of pattern)
2. Zipper (about the same size of your pillow, or a little bigger)
3. Matching Thread
4. Optional: Contrasting Thread (for finishing the edges)
